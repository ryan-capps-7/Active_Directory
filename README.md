# Active_Directory
Setting up an Active Directory environment using Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10 Pro.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this lab is to learn how to configure a server to administer multiple groups made up of many users. After successfully configuring the server, the goal is to create policies that apply to specific roles. These roles could range from administration permissions to deparment based policies.
Overall, by completing this lab (and having just the general curiosity to poke around), one should have a better grasp of how Active Directory works at a very fundamental level.
